COMMU
=====

Commu is a graphical interface designed to aid drawing commutative
diagrams in LaTeX.

Commutative diagrams are used in almost all areas of mathematics,
especially in category theory and related fields, like algebraic
geometry, algebraic topology, logic, etc. They are composed of
objects, disposed in a grid-like fashion, and arrows (of many
different shapes) connecting them.

The usual way of drawing a commutative diagram in LaTeX is to use a
library like XYpic and write complex strings full of mnemonic codes to
draw different arrow shapes, directions, and so on.

With Commu, you have a graphical interface that can export
ready-to-use LaTeX code. You can save your diagram and edit them
afterwards. You can use templates to fill only the relevant changes of
many almost-equal diagrams. And, it exports code using the PGF/TikZ
library, often giving a more pleasant output with respect to XYpic.
